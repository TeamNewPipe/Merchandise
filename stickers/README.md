# Stickers

This directory contains the official stickers of the NewPipe project. They
follow our Corporate Design guidelines.

The files are in their final printing format (i.e., they have a margin of 3mm
on all edges, which is cut off during production).

The files are created as vector graphics, which provides the best quality.

We'd appreciate if you could get in touch with us if you want to use these
files.
